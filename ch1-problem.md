# Whack A Mole Game
This is a whack-a-mole game implemented on to an FPGA Board. The game has two main features. One is the game timer that runs for 20 seconds, second is the score count, which keeps track of the number of counts you successfully hit the mole. We use LEDs to represent moles and we flip switches to whack the mole.
