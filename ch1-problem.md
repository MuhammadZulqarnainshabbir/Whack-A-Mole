# Whack A Mole Game

## Problem Statement

Our project goal was to create a playable Whack-A-Mole game in Verilog and implement it on the FPGA board. The "moles," which are represented by LEDs on the Board, are "whacked" by the user pressing a Switches for each of the LEDs. The 7-segment display is used to demonstrate the game timer, and the user's score.

## Context
The game is a simple whack-a-mole game. The task for the player is to hit the randomly appearing plastic moles that surface from holes in a waist-high, flat-surfaced console with a mallet. The player is rewarded for hitting those moles. For this Project i will be using The Boolean Board which we used in our class for creating this game, LEDs on the board will act as mole while switches will act as hammer with which we will Whack a mole.Its my first experince doing any such project, working on a hardware is biggest part of my excitment.
