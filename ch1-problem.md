# Whack A Mole Game

The game is a simple whack-a-mole game. The task for the player is to hit the randomly appearing plastic moles that surface from holes in a waist-high, flat-surfaced console with a mallet. The player is rewarded for hitting those moles. For this Project i will be using The Boolean Board which we used in our class for creating this game, LEDs on the board will act as mole while switches will act as hammer with which we will Whack a mole.
Its my first experince doing any such project, working on a hardware is biggest part of my excitment.

This is a whack-a-mole game implemented on to an FPGA Board. The game has two main features. One is the game timer that runs for 20 seconds, second is the score count, which keeps track of the number of counts you successfully hit the mole.
