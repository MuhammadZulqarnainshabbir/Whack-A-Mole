# Results
I am delighted to present a functional Whack-A-Mole game on Boolean Board.
The final version of the game allows the user to Whack the Moles with the Switches while also displaying the score for successful hits.
The session timer starts counting down from 20 seconds, and the final score is displayed on the Seven Segment Display.

## Further additions

**Two Players Game**

As i am finished with the project i thought about what could have been added further to
this project to make it more interesting.
I thought if two players play this game on FPGA (for some reason) they have to remember 
the score of one another in order to compare for deciding who is winner. But some if i am able to save socre after a 20 sec session and after every 2 sessions display both on DISP1 and DISP2 Seperatly on board. 

**More Level Game**
The other Idea is to create more level of this to furthur engage the users, after every 20 sec game goes a level up and the speed of LEDs blinking can be increase and in more random way, we can also display number of levels beside the score and time on 7 segment display.



## Takeaways

Learning and working With verilog was new thing for me, In my BS course i had worked with breadboards in a Subject called Digital Logic Designs but never worked on FPGA Boolean Boards since our main focus was software, but working with hardware introduced me to the new side of programming.
